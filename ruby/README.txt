WARNING:  Mass following Twitter accounts can supposedly get your Twitter account banned.  Use with caution and only if you know what you're doing!

Create text file called tokens.txt and put in the following values on separate lines:

consumer_key
consumer_secret
oauth_token
oauth_token_secret

I did this to keep me from checking in source code with these keys.  Put ruby/tokens.txt in the .gitignore file.
